networkmanager auto re-enable device if missing firmware appears.
bombyx doesn't do this.
udev should re-enable the network device if firmware directory changed.
bombyx should monitor the device and take action, not monitor the firmware directory.

what should networkmanager do if firmware file content changes?
bombyx don't care about it, it's the responsibility of udev.
